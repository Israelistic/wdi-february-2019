## History

- created in 10 days by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995

- was named `JavaScript` because `Java`, a different programming language, was popular at the time

- much of its syntax comes from the "c" language

- was standardized by ECMA, and now-a-days JavaScript is sometimes referred to as ECMAScript or ES6, ES7, etc. for each new version

- was slow to evolve for the first few decades

- was a maligned language for a long time that developers reluctantly learned in order to make browsers interactive

- in the last 5 years it has been evolving quickly and it now the most popular language
---


## Environments

JavaScript can run in a browser, or on a server / laptop / computer (with `node`)
---


## Browser

- open the dev tools (`option + command + i`) to test JavaScript out in the browser

- when run in the browser, you have access to the Browser's APIs, and can manipulate the page

- for example:


```js
document.body.innerHTML = 'hi'
```
---


## JavaScript on Web Pages

- include it in a script tag or a separate file

`index.html`:

```html
<html>
 <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <script>
    console.log("My execution is coming from the script tag")
  </script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="app.js"></script>
  <body>
    <h1>JS Demo</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

`app.js`:

```js
console.log("My execution is coming from app.js")
```
---


## Node

With node, you can run JavaScript on a server.

Node provides APIs to system such as your file system
---


## Comments

```js
// I am a Comment
```

```js`
 /*
    I am
    a comment
    too
 */
```
---



## Types and Data Structures

Number

String

Boolean

Function

Object

Array
---


## Booleans

### falsy

- false
- 0
- "" (empty string)
- null
- undefined
- NaN

### Truthy

Everything else, including:

- '0'
- [] (empty array)
---


## Variables: const, let and var

`var` - the original way to define a variable

`let` - the new way to define a variable that may mutate

`const` - the new way to define a variable that won't change

My recommendation:

- always use `const` until you find you have to mutate it, then switch it to `let`
---


## If Statements

```js
const colour = 'blue'

if (colour == 'red') {
  console.log('brick');
} else if (colour == 'blue') {
  console.log('sky');
} else {
  console.log('not sure')
}
```
---


## Ternary

```js
const author = 'douglas adams';

const answer = author == 'douglas adams' ? 42 : 'not sure'

```
---


## Switch Statements

```js
const colour = 'blue'

switch (colour) {
  case 'red':
    console.log('brick');
    break;
  case 'blue':
    console.log('sky');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('not sure');
}
```
---


## Functions

```js
function add(a, b) {
  const result = a + b;
  return result;
}

add(3, 4);
```
---


## Return Values

- undefined is return if no return value is specified
---


## Loops

```js
let count = 1;

while (count <= 10) {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
}

console.log('done');
```
---


## Arrays

```js
const colours = ['red', 'blue'];
```
---


## Objects

```js
const colours = {
  red: 'brick',
  blue: 'sky'
}

colours.red
colours['blue']
```
---


## `this`

- like self in python
---


## Scope

- declarations within functions can only see within that function and it's children
---


## Coercion

```js
1000 == '1000' // true
1000 === '1000' // false
```
---


## Documentation

- Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)
---


## Search tips

- add `mdn` to your search keywords to get the
- add `vanilla js` to your search to mitigate `jquery` results
---


## JavaScript is everywhere

- browser
- servers
- desktop applications (using the electron framework)<br>(i.e. open in the inspector in Atom with `Option + Command + i` and you'll see it's just a chrome browser)
---
