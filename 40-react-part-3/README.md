# Intro to React: Day 3

Today we'll start an app from scratch and build the foundation of a simple film library. Over the next couple of days you'll add more functionality to this app and learn new React concepts along the way.

## Agenda

- Take a look at what we're building
- Break down the work we need to do
- Start a new app from scratch (well...close enough)
- Progress through the app, reviewing concepts
- Passing event handlers down through the component tree
- Saving state
- Learn about `useContext`

This will be a code-heavy session, but you don't need to code along if you don't want to. Do what works best for you!
