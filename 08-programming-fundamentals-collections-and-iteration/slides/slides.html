# How collections and iteration fit into the overall course
---

--

### Week 1:<br>Git, HTML, CSS

--

## Week 2 (this week!):
  Monday: data types, variables, flow control<br>
--
  Tuesday (yesterday): functions and methods<br>
--
  ***Wednesday (today!): collections and iteration***<br>
--
  Thursday (tomorrow): problem solving<br>
--
  Friday: Objected Oriented Programming (OOP)<br>

--

### Week 3 and beyond:<br>OOP, Debugging, Databases, Data-Modelling, Frameworks, Templating, Request-Response, Project Planning, APIs, Testing, JavaScript, React
---

Collections and iteration are a fundamental part of programming, and it's likely you'll use them in almost all future programs you write.

# Transit Planner

We'll explore collections and iteration through a handy transit planner.

# Fare Calculator
---

### Requirements

Create a function that accepts a *list* of passengers and returns the total fare.

### Prices

<pre>
Adult:   3.25<br>
Student: 2.10<br>
Senior:  2.10<br>
Child:   Free<br>
</pre>
---
layout: true

# Lists
---

- create an empty list with `[]`
- add to the list with `.append`
---

## Add one of each passenger type to the list:

### Code

--

```py
passengers = []

passengers.append('adult')
passengers.append('student')
passengers.append('senior')
passengers.append('child')

print(passengers)
```
---

## Iterate through the list to find the total fare:

### Code

--

```py
total = 0.0

for passenger in passengers:
  if passenger == 'adult':
    total += 3.25
  elif passenger == 'student':
    total += 2.10
  elif passenger == 'senior':
    total += 2.10
  elif passenger == 'child':
    total += 0.0

formatted_total = '{:.2f}'.format(total)

print(formatted_total)
```
---

## Each item in the list is accessible through its `index`

### Code

```py
passengers[0]
passengers[1]
passengers[2]
passengers[3]
```

--

Indexes start at `0` (for the first item in the list) and go up consecutively
---

### Try to get an item by `index` that's beyond the last item

```py
passengers[4]
```
---

## It turns out the senior doesn't want to travel with the group any longer

## Let's remove them with `pop`

### Code

--

```py
passengers.pop(2)
```
---

## Two more adults wants to join

### Code

--
```py
passengers.append('adult')
passengers.append('adult')
```
---

## Another child wants to join, but wants to sit next to the first child

### Code

--

```py
passengers.insert(2, 'child')
```
---

## The fare inspector wants to ensure everyone has paid their fare and is asking everyone to line up alphabetically by passenger type

### Code

--

```py
sorted(passengers) # returns the list sorted, but doesn't modify the original

passengers.sort()  # modifies the original list, and then returns None
```
---

## The fare inspector doesn't like this order and wants everyone to line up in the opposite order

### Code

--

```py
list(reversed(passengers)) # returns the list reversed, but doesn't modify the original

passengers.reverse()       # reverses the original list, and then returns None
```
---

## Oh no! It looks like the second and third passengers don't have a Proof-of-Payment

### Let's find out who they are using a `slice`

### Code

--

```py
print(passengers[1:3])
```

--

Phew...

# Station Features
---

## Requirements

Find out what line number a station is on
---
layout: true

# Dictionaries
---

### A data type that stores key-value pairs

Create them with `{}`
---

### Create a few example stations and what lines they're on

```py
stations = {}

stations['Finch']       = 'line 1'
stations['Main Street'] = 'line 2'
stations['Midland']     = 'line 3'
stations['Leslie']      = 'line 4'

print(stations)
```
---

### What line is Leslie station on?

### Code

--

```py
stations['Leslie']
```
---

Let's import all the stations and their line numbers:

### Code

```
from data import stations_with_line_numbers
```

--

... and print them out:

```py
print(stations_with_line_numbers)
```
---

## Let's print them out a little neater:

### Code


```py
for station, line_number in stations_with_line_numbers.items():
  print(line_number + ': ' + station)
```
---

## Let's print out stations that are on line three:

### Code

--

```py
for station, line_number in stations_with_line_numbers.items():
  if line_number == 'Line 3':
    print(station)
```
---

## Let's see what lines are available

### Code

--
```py
set(stations.values())
```
---

## Let's see just the station names

```py
stations.keys()
```
---
layout: false

# Ranges

- let's print out stations organized by line using a `range`
---

# Other Exercises

- what stations have bathrooms?

- what stations are accessible?

- what stations have bathrooms and are accessible?

- what stations start with the letter 'B'?
---
layout: false
