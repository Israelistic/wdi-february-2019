# OOP - Part 2

Today we'll be going further in depth into Object Oriented Programming to see how we can use objects to create groupings of objects that have similar state and behaviour. We'll also see how you can create state and behaviour that are attached to the class rather than to instances of objects.

## Agenda

* Classes and Instances
* Working with different Objects that have the same properties and impelement the same methods
* Class variables and methods
* Making objects comparable with `__lt__`, `__gt__` and `__eq__`
